# LINKA integration and implementation matrix

This matrix separates repository evidence from device, provider and production proof. Status reflects the last GitHub repository inspection during the 2026-11-09 recovery, not a live provider check.

| Capability | Repository evidence | Current status | Remaining proof/dependency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android application shell | Kotlin and Jetpack Compose source under app/ | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED | Re-run build/tests after future changes; real-device compatibility |
| Nearby discovery | Nearby Connections code and manifest permissions | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED | Physical device and Google Play Services matrix |
| Device identity and trusted pairing | Android Keystore identity, signed QR identity and peer handshake | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED; AUTOMATED TESTED | Independent security review and real-device trust tests |
| Direct nearby audio | Audio capture/playback, G.711 framing and encrypted voice sessions | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED; AUTOMATED TESTED at source level | Two-phone SIM/data/internet-off audible call proof |
| Multi-hop offline routing | Mesh router, bounded routes, relay consent and opaque routed payloads | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED; AUTOMATED TESTED at source level | Four-or-more-phone voice test, performance and field validation |
| Android system dialer handoff | Phone hub uses ACTION_DIAL | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED | Physical device/handler checks; not an in-app carrier stack |
| Android SMS handoff | ACTION_SENDTO to installed SMS app | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED | Physical device/handler checks; not integrated SMS/MMS |
| Contacts/recent-call handoff | Intents to Android system apps | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED | Device/system-handler checks |
| Backend signed device challenge | backend/api source | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED; API CI previously passed | Durable accounts and Android client integration |
| Backend call signaling queue | In-memory runtime and signaling routes | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED; API CI previously passed | Durable presence/queue design, client integration and real call tests |
| WebRTC media/TURN | No operational media relay verified | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Media topology, provider/infrastructure choice and network tests |
| Browser companion | Static source under web/ served by the API application | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED as a companion | Full account-based calling/messaging web app is NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| Render deployment | Historical details in docs/RENDER_API_SERVICE.md | HISTORICALLY DOCUMENTED; NOT LIVE VERIFIED IN THIS GITHUB-ONLY RECOVERY | Check dashboard, health, environment and current provider status before relying on it |
| Jamaican number provisioning | Product requirement and compatibility plan | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Real number inventory, agreements, eligibility and regulatory review |
| International number provisioning | Product scope documented | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Provider country coverage, number types, local-presence rules and contracts |
| SIP/PSTN calling | No production carrier adapter verified | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Carrier/wholesale provider, routing, caller ID, rate, billing and approvals |
| External SMS/MMS | Android system-app handoff only | NOT IMPLEMENTED as integrated service | Messaging provider, destination coverage, sender registration, delivery receipts and pricing |
| Internal LINKA chat | No complete persistent messaging service verified | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Account identity, durable storage, delivery/push and client implementation |
| Internet audio/video | Signaling API exists; media and client integration incomplete | PARTIAL FOUNDATION; NOT END-TO-END VERIFIED | WebRTC client/media path, TURN where needed, signaling integration and device/browser tests |
| Credit wallet and ledger | No production wallet/ledger verified | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Durable ledger, pricing model, atomic/idempotent updates and reconciliation |
| Payments | No processor integration verified | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Provider onboarding, webhook security, refunds, disputes and market support |
| Destination rate finder | No provider-backed rate catalog verified | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Current tariff feed/API, rate versioning, taxes and number-type classification |
| SIM/eSIM integration | Current Android manifest does not establish provisioning | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Android role/API design, carrier/eSIM partner and device tests |
| Free-first route options | backend/api/src/domain/route-options.mjs with unit tests | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED; AUTOMATED TESTED as a provider-independent policy core | Provider eligibility/rate feeds, API wiring, Android/web selection UI and durable user consent are not yet integrated |
| E.164 destination normalization | backend/api/src/domain/e164.mjs with unit tests | SOURCE IMPLEMENTED; AUTOMATED TESTED for international-format canonicalization | Country/number-type resolution, number assignment and provider availability still require numbering metadata and provider inventory |\n| Automatic route switching | Pure policy allows free-to-free switching; paid fallback requires exact-quote preauthorization and a spend cap | PARTIAL FOUNDATION; AUTOMATED TESTED at policy level | Provider route discovery, user preference persistence and end-to-end route switching tests |
| Emergency calling | Not implemented; README states LINKA is not an emergency service | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Specialist provider, regulatory approval, location and emergency-service validation |

## CI and repository evidence recovered

- Default branch main was at commit a14baf36ac90dfb1f78324cccaf7e1a26180e81d.
- Android CI run 41781000834 for that commit completed successfully. Its build-and-test job concluded success at 2026-11-04T05:46:12Z.
- LINKA API CI run 41780783071 for commit aaeacf7d225f315c55d7b0aaeceac3fd3ed905ca completed successfully on 2026-11-04.
- GitHub Pages deployment run 41780817544 failed at Configure GitHub Pages; upload and deploy were skipped. Repository history later removed that Pages workflow and documented a single Render origin.
- These are historical GitHub Actions results. This recovery did not rerun CI or access external service dashboards.

## Status update rule

Update this matrix when capabilities change. A source change alone may move a row to SOURCE IMPLEMENTED, not DEVICE TESTED, PROVIDER ENABLED or PRODUCTION VERIFIED. Attach an issue, test run, provider evidence or release reference for each higher status.
